          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p  I’m ambitious Web Developer who has spent the last 5 years learning the necessary programming languages while attending college full-time. After working with Major League Baseball, SIDEARM Sports, and a few other respected companies, I believe my skills and passion set me above other candidates. I am obsessed with continuing to learn new languages/skills in the industry to become a better developer!
